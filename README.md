# Cross-Disorder GRN
For my thesis, I use the GRAND database which implements PANDA (https://netzoo.github.io/zooanimals/panda/) to produce tissue-specific bipartite Gene-Regulatory Networks (GRNs).

I subsequently cross-reference DEGs for various disorders to TFs in the GRN to produce relevant pathways.
